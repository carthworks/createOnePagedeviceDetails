Machine Test: ReactJS Device List Application
Objective:
Create a one-page ReactJS application that displays a list of devices with their details. The devices' data is stored in a devices.json file, which should be loaded dynamically via an HTTP request. Once completed, upload the project to GitHub.

Instructions:
Set Up the React Project:

Use create-react-app to initialize the project.
Ensure that the project follows best practices and has a clean structure.
Fetch Devices Data:

Fetch the device data from the provided URL.
Handle loading and error states appropriately.
Display Devices:

Create a component to display the list of devices.
Each device should display its name, description, location, and last result.
Styling:

Use CSS to style the application.
Ensure the application is responsive and visually appealing.
Push to GitHub:

Commit your code and push it to a new repository on GitHub.
If you do not have a GitHub account, create one.
Provided API Endpoint:
Fetch the devices data from the following URL: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Tehnix/c9d53939b2ed600b321fed8e1898f3a7/raw/dfe7adaf6f73e320ae4ed42761d6b50cf25eb569/devices.json

{
  "devices": [
    {"name": "Device 1", "description": "This is device 1", "location": "Living room", "lastResult": 123141},
    {"name": "Device 2", "description": "This is device 2", "location": "Office", "lastResult": 267},
    ...
  ]
}

Submission:
Submit the GitHub repository link with the completed project.

Evaluation Criteria:
Correctness and functionality of the application.
Code quality and structure.
Handling of asynchronous operations and error states.
Styling and responsiveness of the UI.
Proper use of Git and GitHub for version control.


This test will help evaluate your skills in setting up a React project, fetching data asynchronously, handling state, and styling components. Good luck!
